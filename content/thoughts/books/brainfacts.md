# BrainFacts, a primer on the brain and nervous system
This will mostly be just notes at first, and maybe some reflection later


## Basics
I already knew this, but we don't just use 10% of our brains! Fun facts. 
1 in 4 people suffer a neurological or psychiatric condition.

There are 2 types of neurons, some excite others and try to make them fire, and some inhibit others from passing signals. The latter can be useful for separating different circuits and columns from crosstalk when that is bad.

Medicines like Fluoxetine (Prozac) are "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors". These stop "reuptake" which is the process that your brain uses to take neurotransmitters "out of circulation".

Chemicals like THC are called _neuromodulators_, these affect how many neurotransmitters get emitted by the axons, this changing the functioning of the brain.

## Senses & Perception
* ### Vision
Visual processing accounts for about 30% of the cerebral cortex! That's way more than other senses. We also know more about vision than other senses. The retina has built in processing, sort of like modern CMOS chips. 
Human eyes have about 125 million photoreceptors, if each photoreceptor was a pixel, then that's a resolution 3 times larger than 8k!  
Interestingly, the eyes are split down the center into right and left visual fields, the left visual field goes to the right hemisphere, and vice versa. The same happens with touch. A little section of the brain in the occipital lobe does the first step of visual processing and some of the steps it goes through will be recognizable to people who have worked in computer vision before. It can do edge detection, as well as motion detection. 

* ### Hearing
"Hair cells" in the cochlea turn the vibration of the fluid into signals. These work by having different membranes tuned to different frequencies, these movements are then detected by the hair cells. Interestingly, the left side of the brain is the primary hemisphere for processing speech. People with damage in this section of the brain can hear you but not understand you. Loss of hearing is caused by loss hair cells, which doen't regrow.

* ### Taste & smell
Test and smell are very similar in that they both use chemicals to get information. Taste buds start to degenerate at around the age of 50, leading to a loss of taste. All tastes are tasted everywhere on the tongue, contrary to common belief.  
With new research into stem cell therapies, we might be one day able to restore taste or smell.

* ### Touch
Touch has two different pathways, A-beta and C fibers, A is faster but thicker, and C is slower but thinner. Touch is mapped onto an area of your brain, where more sensitive areas like the fingers get more space than less sensitive ones. The two areas most sensitive to touch are your lips and your hands. 

* ### Pain
Pain is emotional and sensory. Pain uses it own sensory fibers, called nociceptors. Different nociceptors respond to different kinds of pain, like heat, wounds, or toxins. When damage is detected, chemicals that cause inflammation are released. This then triggers continued pain perception. elongated pain can cause the nervous system in that area to become more sensitive. C Fibers are used for things like ache, and A-delta for precise pain. 

## Movement
Reflexes directly connect to the muscles near them, bypassing the brain altogether. Reflexes exist because it was evolutionarily advantageous to be able to protect yourself from injury fast. 

## Learning, Memory & Emotion
There are different types of memory:
* ### Declarative memory
This type memory is used for data, facts, and events.
* ### Semantic
This is for cultural knowledge, ideas, and concepts. For example names of cities, definitions of words, how to do math, or dates.
* ### Episodic
These are memories of experiences, like remembering sounds, sights and emotions connected to an event.
Emotional importance of a memory is determined by the amygdala. The amygdala also regulates fight or flight.
* ### Working memory
This is like RAM in a computer, a far more limited in quantity short-term memory solution for easy manipulation.
* ### Nondeclarative memory
This type is recalled without effort like motor skills.

### How memories are saved
Memories are encoded into the shape and number of synapses, as well as how many receptors there are. 

### Emotions
The amygdala, insula and a part of the midbrain are most linked to emotion. The brain assigns good emotions to things that will promote better emotional advantages, and bad to things that wont. Emotional parts of the brain change over time, especially in teens, and this transitional period may explain why teens are more prone to risk.  
To make good things worth your while, the brain can use rewards pathways like the dopamine one (Which iirc is one of the things that doesn't work as intended in ADHD suffering people). There are also dopamine inhibitors, which can be used for punishment. 

## Thinking, Planning & Language
The human brain has multiple filters in place to stop the constant noise from the world. If I remember correctly, this may be one of the parts of the brain that doesn't work well in autistic people (don't cite me on that lol).   
Most short term memories are just loose approximations based on past memories. Sort of like how an AI can turn an image into a set of parameters it has learned. These rely on semantic memory, which I talked about earlier. Some _individual neurons_ may be responsible for specific people or things, these are called "concept neurons". If information is blocked to the regions where this happens, some senses may not be able to create associations to memories, leading to cases where the person knows what something is, but is not able to recognize it through whatever sense is impaired.  

### Speech production and language
The area of the brain called "Broca's area" is responsible for speech production, and if someone where to have it damaged then they would not be able to create language, but still understand it. That sounds like my worst nightmare. This is called non-fluent aphasias, where speech is not able to be made, but still understood. That's in contrast to fluent aphasias, where speech production is fully functional, but the produced words make no sense. There is another type of aphasias called "pure word deafness" which is caused by damage to the temporal lobe. People who suffer from this cannot understand speech at any level, but are not deaf. They can still process music and can even detect tone, emotion, and gender of the speaker, but they can't connect the sounds of words to their meanings. They can still understand written language however.  

### Executive function & cognition
These take place in the most complex part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC controls the rest of brain functions. Executive function refers to the ability of the PFC to coordinate the rest of the brains function, like retrieving memories. Executive function has 3 main jobs:
1. #### Inhibition:
This is when your brain stops you from doing behavior that is inappropriate, toddlers develop this at an early stage, if only in small amounts. 
2. #### Working Memory
Working memory, which I have talked about earlier, is also managed by executive function. This is very important for focus and stuff like that, which is why ADHD makes it way harder to focus.
3. #### Shifting
Shifting is the ability to adapt to new conditions and/or plans. I am very aware of this, as I _hate_ having plan changes and have ADHD. 

These all work together to be able to make decisions. 

### Social Neuroscience
Mentalizing is the process of "simulating" other people's thought processes in your mind. This is very important for social interaction and understanding others. This is the basis for empathy and "theory of mind," which is understanding why other people do things.
