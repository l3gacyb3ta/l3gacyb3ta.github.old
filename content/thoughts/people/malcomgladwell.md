# Cool people - Malcom Gladwell
This is the first in my soon to be long list of people I admire.

## Works of his I enjoy
- Revisionist History, possible the best history podcast ever
- The Tipping Point, a really good book that brought the idea of a tipping point for basically anything into the mainstream.

## Why I admire him
He has done so much and so many amazing things in his life, he leads teams, writes books, and is one of the most productive poeple I am aware of. Productivity is something I strive to have, and I'm still working on it, so people who are productive amaze me.
