# My thoughts on French 3 H
## First impressions
I may already speak french, but this seems really easy! (at least [module 1](/notes/school/French3H/module1/lrp)) I hope that I can get this done fast & well so that I can have some free time. At least it isnt like 8th grade math again! (For context, I took 8th grade math over the summer to qualify for Physical Science H, and it was a nightmare)
