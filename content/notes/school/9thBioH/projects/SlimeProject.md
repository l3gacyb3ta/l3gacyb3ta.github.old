# Slime Project 
## Aug 10 2021

[Lecture notes from today](/notes/school/9thBioH/daily/aug10-21)

### Background research

Words + definitions:
 1. Viscosity: The speed at which something flows
 2. Polymer: Long molecule
 
 ### Hypothesis:
 Applying more shear force, as well as shaving creme, borax, baking soda, and contact solution to the slime during creation will lead to stronger links between molecules, making it better for slime useage.
 
 ### Experiment:
 - Take 2-3 oz of glue and mix with 1 teaspoon of contact solution.
 - Add shaving creme, around 2oz.
 - Mix vigorously
 - Add around two more teaspoons of contact solution
 - Add 1 teaspoon borax
 - Add 1 tablespoon Baking Soda
 - beat that slime like pizza dough
 - Clean table
 
 ### Result:
 Ok slime, 6.5/10
