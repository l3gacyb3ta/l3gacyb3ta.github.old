You may be thinking "Why is OS X so intresting?" Well _this_ is intresting because it\'s running by a VM!

Firstly, you may be asking yourselves "Why would you do this?" or "What is the point of this?".  

The point is, I can, so why not‽

Moving on, how?  

First, I installed the "Update to Catalina" app on my dad\'s MacBook Pro. I then followed a guide to transform this app into an .iso image.  

Then, I installed VirtualBox, and an expansion for it, to allow me to edit some characteristics of the VMs.  

I tricked the VM into thinking it was an iMac, and then installed OS X Catalina onto it.  

I then spent a while messing around with drivers to get internet bridging up.  

Once that was working, I updated to Big Sur. That was supprisingly easy!
